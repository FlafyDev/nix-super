# Nix Super

## It's [Nix](https://nixos.org), but super!

This is an upstream-tracking fork of Nix that includes various patches, some controversial in nature and not fit for Nix upstream.

Some of the patches included are: 
- nix-flake-default from [nix-dram](https://github.com/dramforever/nix-dram)
- enable-all-experimental from the old [nixExperimental](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/pull/120141)
- Full thunk evaluation in flake inputs
- Some UI improvements
